# PRD: Duolingo Immersive Conversations

A real-time, AI-powered language-learning experience enabling users to engage in dynamic,
adaptive dialogues that build speaking confidence through real-world scenarios.

## TL;DR
Speaking fluently in a new language is one of the biggest challenges for learners. Immersive
Conversations introduces AI-driven, real-time dialogue simulations where users practice
speaking in real-world contexts, receive immediate pronunciation and grammar feedback,
and interact with an adaptive AI tutor that tailors conversations to their proficiency level. This
feature helps learners build confidence, overcome fear of speaking, and reinforce their language
skills through personalized, gamified practice.

## Goals

### Business Goals
1. Increase user engagement and retention by making language learning more
interactive and rewarding.
2. Improve spoken fluency and pronunciation through real-time AI-driven feedback.
3. Boost Duolingo Plus subscriptions by offering premium features such as advanced
conversation topics, offline AI conversations, and personalized coaching.
4. Differentiate Duolingo from competitors by being the leading AI-powered language
learning platform with real-time conversation simulations.

### User Goals
1. Gain speaking confidence in a low-pressure, AI-guided environment.
2. Receive real-time feedback on pronunciation, grammar, and fluency.
3. Engage in adaptive conversations that adjust based on their proficiency.
4. Practice at their own pace, without fear of judgment.

### Non-Goals
1. Replacing human tutors – This feature supplements, rather than replaces, human
conversation practice.
2. Unmoderated free-form AI chat – AI conversations will remain structured and guided.
3. Addressing every cultural nuance at launch – We will start with major dialect
variations and refine over time.

* Continuous accuracy monitoring across dialects and accents.

### 2. Accent & Dialect Testing
* Ensure X% accuracy across 10+ major accents per language.
* Collect real user samples to improve AI recognition.
* Regional pronunciation variation mapping.

### 3. Performance Benchmarks
* Maintain <500ms response time across:
  * High-end & low-end devices
  * Wi-Fi, 4G, and offline mode
  * Different network conditions

### 4. A/B Testing Strategy
* Test different AI conversation styles:
  * Scripted vs. adaptive responses
  * Strict correction vs. conversational encouragement
  * Various notification timing and formats
* Compare engagement & retention rates across variations.

### 5. Edge Cases & Failure Handling
* What if the AI misunderstands context?
  * Fallback to simpler conversation patterns
  * Offer alternative phrasings or clarification prompts
* What if users consistently struggle?
  * Adaptive difficulty adjustment
  * Suggest skill-appropriate scenarios
* What if network conditions are poor?
  * Graceful degradation to text-only mode
  * Offline conversation caching

## Technical Considerations

### Privacy & Data Handling
* User voice data is not permanently stored—only processed in-session.
* Users must explicitly consent before voice recording.
* GDPR & CCPA compliance: Users can delete all stored conversation data.

### Resource Requirements

  * Real-time audio processing capabilities
  * Multi-language speech recognition models
  * Pronunciation scoring systems
* AI Model Training Data
  * Native speaker conversation samples
  * Common learner mistake patterns
  * Cultural context datasets

### Capacity Planning
* Initial launch support for 1M daily active users
* Scaling plan for 10M+ users within 6 months
