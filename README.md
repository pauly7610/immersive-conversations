# AI Language Learning Conversation Interface

A React-based implementation of an intelligent language learning interface that enables real-time conversation practice with AI, helping learners build confidence through adaptive dialogues and immediate feedback.

## Overview

This project implements the user interface components for an AI-powered language learning system, which aims to:
- Provide real-time conversation practice in multiple languages
- Deliver immediate pronunciation and grammar feedback
- Adapt difficulty based on user proficiency
- Create an immersive learning environment through real-world scenarios

## Features

- **Scenario-Based Learning**
  - Curated real-world conversation scenarios
  - Progressive difficulty levels (A1-C2)
  - Cultural context adaptation
  - Interactive dialogue flows

- **Real-Time AI Interaction**
  - Speech recognition integration
  - Immediate pronunciation feedback
  - Grammar correction
  - Natural language processing
  
- **Adaptive Learning System**
  - Dynamic difficulty adjustment
  - Personalized vocabulary expansion
  - Progress tracking
  - Performance analytics

- **Accessibility Features**
  - Text-based alternatives
  - Speech impediment support
  - Offline mode capabilities
  - Multi-modal interaction options

## Component Details

### ScenarioSelection
Browse and select from various conversation scenarios:
```javascript
const ScenarioSelection = ({ onScenarioSelect }) => {
  const [selectedCategory, setSelectedCategory] = useState('All');
  // Component implementation
};
```

### Conversation Interface
Real-time conversation with AI tutor:
```javascript
const Conversation = ({ scenarioId }) => {
  const [isRecording, setIsRecording] = useState(false);
  // Speech recognition and AI interaction logic
};
```

### Review Component
Post-conversation feedback and analysis:
```javascript
const Review = ({ transcript }) => {
  const [rating, setRating] = useState(5);
  // Feedback and analytics implementation
};
```

## Implementation Notes
- Uses mock data for demonstration purposes
- Real implementation requires integration with AI language models
- Styling follows modern language learning app patterns
- Built with mobile-first responsive design
- Implements Web Speech API for voice recognition

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Integration with advanced AI language models
