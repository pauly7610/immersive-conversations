PRD: Duolingo Immersive Conversations
A real-time, AI-powered language-learning experience enabling users to engage in dynamic,
adaptive dialogues that build speaking confidence through real-world scenarios.
TL;DR
Speaking fluently in a new language is one of the biggest challenges for learners. Immersive
Conversations introduces AI-driven, real-time dialogue simulations where users practice
speaking in real-world contexts, receive immediate pronunciation and grammar feedback,
and interact with an adaptive AI tutor that tailors conversations to their proficiency level. This
feature helps learners build confidence, overcome fear of speaking, and reinforce their language
skills through personalized, gamified practice.
Goals
Business Goals

Increase user engagement and retention by making language learning more
interactive and rewarding.
Improve spoken fluency and pronunciation through real-time AI-driven feedback.
Boost Duolingo Plus subscriptions by offering premium features such as advanced
conversation topics, offline AI conversations, and personalized coaching.
Differentiate Duolingo from competitors by being the leading AI-powered language
learning platform with real-time conversation simulations.

User Goals

Gain speaking confidence in a low-pressure, AI-guided environment.
Receive real-time feedback on pronunciation, grammar, and fluency.
Engage in adaptive conversations that adjust based on their proficiency.
Practice at their own pace, without fear of judgment.

Non-Goals

Replacing human tutors – This feature supplements, rather than replaces, human
conversation practice.
Unmoderated free-form AI chat – AI conversations will remain structured and guided.
Addressing every cultural nuance at launch – We will start with major dialect
variations and refine over time.

User Experience
1. Scenario Selection

Users pick from curated, real-world conversation scenarios, such as:

Travel (ordering food, asking for directions, booking a hotel)
Work & Business (job interviews, business meetings, negotiating)
Casual Conversations (introductions, small talk, discussing hobbies)
Advanced Topics (debating current events, storytelling)



2. AI-Driven Dialogue

AI simulates a native speaker, guiding users through dynamic, interactive
conversations.
Pronunciation Scoring (real-time feedback on clarity and accent).
Grammar & Syntax Correction (suggests more natural phrasing).
Adaptive Vocabulary Expansion (introduces synonyms, idioms, and formal/informal
variations).

3. Cultural Context Handling

Region-Specific Language Variations: AI adjusts for dialectical differences (e.g.,
Mexican Spanish vs. Castilian Spanish).
Avoiding Cultural Faux Pas: AI flags inappropriate phrases and offers culturally
appropriate alternatives.
Localized Conversational Norms: AI teaches socially expected responses (e.g.,
formal vs. informal greetings).

4. Error Recovery Scenarios

Handling Poor Audio Quality & Background Noise:

AI prompts users to repeat phrases or slow down speaking speed.
Uses noise reduction algorithms to filter non-speech audio.


Mid-Conversation Internet Disconnections:

AI saves progress so users can resume where they left off.
Offers offline mode for Duolingo Plus subscribers.


Unrecognizable Pronunciation Errors:

AI detects struggling words and provides phonetic breakdowns.
Offers written prompts to assist users.



5. Accessibility Considerations

Speech Impediment Support:

Users can opt for text-based response mode instead of speaking aloud.


Accent & Dialect Adaptation:

AI learns user-specific accents over time to improve recognition.


Alternative Interaction Modes:

Users who can't speak aloud can use text input with AI-generated spoken
responses.



6. Gamification & Progress Tracking

XP & Streak Bonuses for daily speaking practice.
Personalized AI-generated feedback summaries post-session.
Badges for achieving speaking milestones.

Success Metrics
Engagement & Retention

% increase in daily active users engaging with speaking exercises.
Conversation completion rates (tracks if users finish a session).
Average session duration in Immersive Conversations.

Learning Outcomes

Pronunciation improvement over time (measured by AI accuracy detection).
Reduction in hesitation gaps (tracking user pauses before responding).

User Experience & Satisfaction

User-reported fluency confidence (via periodic surveys).
CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) score for AI conversations.

Business Impact

Increase in Duolingo Plus conversions due to premium features.
Reduction in churn for engaged users.

Testing & Quality Assurance
1. Speech Recognition Accuracy

AI must recognize >90% of spoken words correctly in controlled environments.
Error rates must be ≤10% for non-native speakers.

2. Accent & Dialect Testing

Ensure X% accuracy across 10+ major accents per language.
Collect real user samples to improve AI recognition.

3. Performance Benchmarks

Maintain <500ms response time across:

High-end & low-end devices
Wi-Fi, 4G, and offline mode



4. A/B Testing Strategy

Test different AI conversation styles:

Scripted vs. adaptive responses
Strict correction vs. conversational encouragement


Compare engagement & retention rates across variations.

Technical Considerations
Privacy & Data Handling

User voice data is not permanently stored—only processed in-session.
Users must explicitly consent before voice recording.
GDPR & CCPA compliance: Users can delete all stored conversation data.
