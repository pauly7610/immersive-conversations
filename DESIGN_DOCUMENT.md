# Design Document for Language Learning Application

## Overview

This document outlines the design principles and implementation details for the language learning application. The application is inspired by Duolingo and aims to provide an engaging and user-friendly experience for language learners.

## Design Principles

1. **Color Scheme**

   - The application uses a bright and friendly color palette, primarily greens, whites, and blues, to create a familiar and inviting interface.
   - Light Theme: Background color `#f0f8ff`, Text color `#000`.
   - Dark Theme: Background color `#333`, Text color `#fff`.

2. **Typography**

   - The application uses clean and modern sans-serif fonts for readability and a friendly appearance.
   - Font Family: 'Arial', sans-serif.

3. **Icons and Illustrations**

   - The application incorporates playful and educational icons and illustrations to make the learning experience fun and engaging.
   - Consider using libraries like FontAwesome or Material Icons for consistency.

4. **Layout and Navigation**

   - The layout is simple and intuitive, with clear navigation bars or tabs to help users easily access different sections of the app.
   - A top navigation bar is used for primary navigation.

5. **Gamification Elements**

   - The application includes badges, progress bars, and streak indicators to motivate users and track their progress.
   - Badges are styled with a green border and text to highlight achievements.

6. **Feedback and Interactivity**

   - The application provides immediate feedback on user actions, such as pronunciation and grammar corrections, using pop-ups or inline messages.
   - Animations and transitions are used to enhance the user experience.

7. **Responsive Design**
   - The application is designed to be responsive and works well on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Implementation Details

### Styled Components

- **Container**: The main container for each page, styled to be responsive and theme-aware.

  ```javascript
  export const Container = styled.div`
    max-width: 800px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: ${({ theme }) =>
      theme === "light" ? "#f0f8ff" : "#333"};
    color: ${({ theme }) => (theme === "light" ? "#000" : "#fff")};
    font-family: "Arial", sans-serif;
    @media (max-width: 600px) {
      padding: 10px;
    }
  `;
  ```

- **MessageBubble**: Styled for AI and user messages, with animations for smooth transitions.
  ```javascript
  export const MessageBubble = styled.div`
    background-color: ${({ speaker }) =>
      speaker === "AI" ? "#e0f7fa" : "#58cc02"};
    color: ${({ speaker }) => (speaker === "AI" ? "#000" : "#fff")};
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    margin: 5px 0;
    animation: ${fadeIn} 0.5s ease-in-out;
    font-size: 16px;
  `;
  ```

### Components

- **Badge**: Represents achievements with a green border and text.
  ```javascript
  const Badge = ({ title, description }) => {
    return (
      <div
        className="badge"
        style={{
          border: "1px solid #58cc02",
          borderRadius: "5px",
          padding: "10px",
          margin: "5px 0",
        }}
      >
        <h3 style={{ color: "#58cc02" }}>{title}</h3>
        <p>{description}</p>
      </div>
    );
  };
  ```

### User Experience

- **Pronunciation Feedback**: Provides users with immediate feedback on pronunciation using mock data.
- **Cultural Context**: AI responses include cultural context notes to guide users in appropriate language use.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Pronunciation Analysis**: Develop a machine learning model to analyze pronunciation and provide feedback.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Expand support to include additional languages and dialects.
- **Cultural Context Handling**: Incorporate more detailed cultural context into AI responses.

## Conclusion

This design document serves as a guide for maintaining consistency and understanding the design choices made throughout the project. By following these principles, the application aims to provide a user-friendly and engaging experience for language learners.
